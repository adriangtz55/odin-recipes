        <h1>Homemade Guacamole</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avocados-good guacamole starts with good avocados so use the best you can find. Hass are best, most likely you'll be getting Hass if in the US, they make up 95% of what's sold.</li>
            <li>Roma tomato-this adds little bits of sweet tomato-y flavor that pairs perfect with the avocado and lime.</li>
            <li>Red onion- a little goes a long way, and don't forget to rinse to remove the harsh bite first.</li>
            <li>Jalapeno- this adds nice spicy kick. You could try it with another type of pepper such as Serrano (they're spicier) or in a pinch use some cayenne.</li>
            <li>Cilantro- you won't always find cilantro in guacamole but it really adds such a great background flavor.</li>
            <li>Garlic- use fresh garlic not bottled.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper- as always, this brings out the flavors and keeps it from tasting one dimensional.</li>
            <li>Lime- if you don't have lime you could substitute lemon in a pinch.</li>
        </ul>
