        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avocados</strong>-good guacamole starts with good avocados so use the best you can find. Hass are best, most likely you'll be getting Hass if in the US, they make up 95% of what's sold.</li>
            <li><strong>Roma tomato</strong>-this adds little bits of sweet tomato-y flavor that pairs perfect with the avocado and lime.</li>
            <li><strong>Red onion</strong>- a little goes a long way, and don't forget to rinse to remove the harsh bite first.</li>
            <li><strong>Jalapeno</strong>- this adds nice spicy kick. You could try it with another type of pepper such as Serrano (they're spicier) or in a pinch use some cayenne.</li>
            <li><strong>Cilantro</strong>- you won't always find cilantro in guacamole but it really adds such a great background flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>- use fresh garlic not bottled.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>- as always, this brings out the flavors and keeps it from tasting one dimensional.</li>
            <li><strong>Lime</strong>- if you don't have lime you could substitute lemon in a pinch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add avocados to a larger bowl and cut into avocados with a pastry cutter or fork until you've reached the texture you like.</li>
