        <h2>What is Barbacoa?</h2>
        <p>Tradtionally, barbacoa is meat, mostly beef or goat or lamb, that is cooked with seasonings and shredded for filling in tacos, burritos or other Mexican dishes. Mexican barbacoa is usually steam cooked in an underground pit/oven, though sometimes it is cooked on open fires, until the meat is tender and succulent. Served with warm corn tortillas, guacamole and salsa.</p>
